* Imperative - A way in which reason commands the will
* Hypothetical imperative
	* If you want x, do y
* Categorial imperative
	* Good in itself.
	* This can be the only moral imperative
* 1st formulation
	* Universalize the rule and determine effect on society
	* Quick check, waht if that person did the same action to you?
		* Negative reaction -> Evidence taht your will to do taht violates categorial imperative.
* 2nd formulation - Act to treat yourself and other people as ends, not as a means to an end.
	* Wrong to use another person for your benefit
	* All people are moral equals
